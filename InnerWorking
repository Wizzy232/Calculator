Only one class is needed that is the calculator class
Now when a users clicks one of the buttons from 0 to 9
The value should display on the output
The 10 buttons should have the same action lister
We shall use the .getActionCommand() method to know which button was clicked
A typical button is going to be created like this
JButton button = new JButton("1");
so lets say the user clicks on that button
we could now say
String button = event.getActionCommand();
now the message
we already have a string called message which is empty initially
we then say message = message + button + " ";
now the string contains 1
lets now say the user click on add 
message = message + add + " "
message now contains 1 + 
we would change the text on the textarea each time this happens

Now the calculation

When a user clicks a number the number would be stored in the string digits
and the message would be created as before

But when the user click on an operator which is not equals the value of digit is converted into a double
this value it then added to the array list numbers and the operation is added to another arraylist operation

the string digit is then cleared as it awaits another input this process continues until the equal to button is pressed
When the eqaul to button is pressed the digit is still converted to double and passed to the array list numbers but
the operation is not passed. 

We then make a double called total to be equal to numbers[0]

Now we start looping starting with i as 1 and operation as 0 we begin to compute every computation returns a total at the
end of the loop the value of total is then printed to the screen
